# Tristan_Slides

## Description

This project is my own implementation of an online presentation and design platform. 
Inspired by Canva, Google Slides, PowerPoint it is designed to demonstrate a full-stack application.

To get started with your local setup, follow these steps:

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TristanCM347/Tristan_Slides.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Navigate to both the backend and frontend directories and run:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the Application**

In both the backend and frontend directories, start the application using:

```bash
npm start
```

4. **Optional: Reset the Database**

If you need to reset your database to its initial state, you can use the following command:
```bash
npm run reset
```
Note: it can be a little slow sometimes so with some operations be patient :) .
