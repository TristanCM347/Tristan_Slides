- Main Presentation Properties: Adjust main presentation properties directly from the dashboard instead of navigating to the  presentation screen, enhancing speed and user efficiency.
- Modal Details: All modals are very detailed to facilitate ease of use.
- Color Contrast: Great color contrast throughout the interface, using Chrome Web Tools for validation, specifically contrasting color schemes for buttons and text to enhance visibility and usability.
- Responsive and Unique Design: Extensive use of media queries improves responsiveness, catering to various screen sizes and maximizing the display area of the square (best shape for presentations for a webiste needing to cater to every orientation and screen) slides which makes the webiste way more accessible and usable to users.
- Consistent Button Placement: Modern and consistent placement of buttons in the header makes the site easy to navigate.
- Thumbnail and Description Selection: Added features in the form creation process to select thumbnails and descriptions, improving content management and efficiency.
Non Text Content: All non-text content, such as thumbnails, includes text alternatives. 
Text Content: High contrast in text (black on white in forms and modals specifically) improves perceivability.
- Descriptive Tooltips: Tooltips appear on hover for each button in the toolbar and header controls, providing detailed descriptions of their functions.
Form Labeling: Adherence to best understable practices in form labeling for better accessibility and operability as specifically mentioned in lecture notes.
"<label for={someInput}>Name</label>"
"<input id={someInput} />"
Save Button Functionality: Enhances control by letting users decide when to save, which promotes usability and accesbility.
Persistent Error Messages: Error messages and confirmation modals remain visible until the user chooses to close them, enhancing user interaction.
Autosave Button: Allows users to choose this if internet connection is poor and saving every change will slow down their browser / computer
Detailed Error Feedback: Error messages provide detailed feedback, sourced either from the backend or generated in response to user input errors.
Redirection Rules: Implemented safe and very understandable redirection rules across all URLs to prevent navigation errors and ensure user access is appropriately managed based on authentication status and content availability.
- http://localhost:3000/register -> Redirects to dashboard or login
  - http://localhost:3000/login -> Redirects to dashboard or login
  - http://localhost:3000 -> Redirects to dashboard or login
  - http://localhost:3000/dashboard -> Redirects to dashbaord or login
  - http://localhost:3000/presentationId -> Redirects to dashbaord or login or first slide of presentation (depends on the user accessing, if token in storage, if presentaiton exists etc..)
  - http://localhost:3000/presentationId/slideNum -> Redirects to dashbaord or login or first slide of presentation (depends on the user accessing, if token in storage, if presentaiton exists, if slide num exists etcc..)
  - http://localhost:3000/preview/presentationId/slideNum -> Redirects to dashbaord or login or first slide of presentation (depends on the user accessing, if token in storage, if presentaiton exists, if slide num exists etcc..)
  - http://localhost:3000/anystringor/sequence/youchoose -> redirects to dashboard or login
- we folow the most ideal way to use label and input throughout every single form
- Page Navigation: all slides can be cahnged to with left and right arrow keys in both eidtinf and preview presentation
- Form Submission and Exits: all forms can be submitted with enter key and exitted with escape key.
- Language and Headers: The interface language is set to English for clarity, with headers, and different sections used to improve operability.
- Data Rendering Safeguards: UseEffect in React ensures that data needed for forms is fully loaded before rendering, preventing premature submissions and enhancing safety. If users submit form while content isnt loaded then nothing happens either (its equivalent to closing the file)
- Parsability: all html in react has open and close tag to promote html parasability and robustness
- We give users an error and also a solution e.g. when trying to delete if theres only one slide in the presentation
